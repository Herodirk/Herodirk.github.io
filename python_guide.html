        <h1>Python Guide</h1>

        <h2>Installation</h2>
All the calculators run on Python. The calculators will not become public as exes, so you need to be able to run the python files yourself.<br>
Programs to run Python files are called Python interpreters. Most Python code editors come with a Python interpreter.<br>
There are a lot of stand-alone Python interpreters and a lot of code editors with interpreters.<br>
Shown here are two examples, one code editor and one stand-alone interpreter: Spyder from Anaconda and standard Python.<br>
If you are already experienced with a different Python interpreter or code editor, you can use that.<br>
<br>
To get Spyder from Anaconda, you first have to install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/success">Anaconda</a>.<br>
If you end up on the main page of Anaconda, you can skip any registration by clicking the "free download" button in the top right and then clicking "skip registration" underneath the submit button.<br>
After installing Anaconda, you can open Spyder from the Anaconda Navigator.<br>
The main benefit of this program is that Anaconda automatically installs several Python modules, which are also the ones needed for the calculators.<br>
<br>
Standard Python is run through the command promt of your system, this site gives a great tutorial: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp">w3schools</a>.<br>
<br>
For both methods you need to specify a version of Python, Herodirk uses Python 3.12.4 to make the calculators.<br>
The differences in Python versions is not that significant for simple programs like calculators, so other versions might work.

        <h2>Activating calculator</h2>
Now with Python ready, you can download the files for the calculator you want.<br>
Always download the files from <a href="https://github.com/Herodirk">Herodirk's GitHub</a> and get the latest release.<br>
Direct links to the releases of each calculator is at the top of their manual.<br>
Make sure that all the files for the calculator are in the same folder. Do not mix files from different calculators in one folder.<br>
Then with the Python interpreter of your choice, run the main file of the calculator which are always called <span>main.py</span>.<br>
The calculators are programmed as functions. Meaning to actually start the calculator after running the file, you have to run a function.<br>
The function to start a calculator will always be <span>start_app()</span>.<br>
To stop a calculator, there is a button labeled <span>Stop</span> in the bottom right of every calculator.
