        <h1>Herosite</h1>
        A public website with Herodirk's calculators.

        <h2>Calculator Types</h2>
        The calculators are first developed in Python and released as raw code to GitHub.<br>
        However as it is not exactly easy for everyone to use this programming language, JavaScript versions will also be hosted on this website.<br>
        The calculators in Python still get priority and the JavaScript versions might not have the same features.<br>
        Check out the <a href="python_guide.html">Python guide</a> for how to use the Python version of the calculators.<br>
        Check out the <a href="javascript_guide.html">JavaScript guide</a> for how to use the JavaScript version of the calculators.

        <h2>Hypixel Skyblock Calculators</h2>
        Hypixel Skyblock is a minigame on the Hypixel Network (<a href="https://hypixel.net/">mc.hypixel.net</a>). Hypixel Skyblock will be abbreviated to HSB from now on.<br>
        HSB is a MMORPG made in Minecraft. It is a very grindy game, once you fully commit, you can spend thousands of hours playing without noticing.<br>
        Those thousands of hours of playtime is valuable time, so players like to play optimally. That's why calculators are made to find the most efficient method and setup.
        
        <h3><a href="minion/index.html">Minion Calculator</a></h3>
        Apart from manual grinding, there is also content that you do not have to do a lot for, basically like an idle game. Minions are one of these idle game like parts of HSB.<br>
        Minion work 24/7 on your private island. With only 2 actions they can perform, they really seem very simple. But like any good idle game, there are upgrades.<br>
        These upgrades can make things complicated very quickly. Especially when the code, that is bringing these upgrades to life, can do some very funky things.<br>
        That's is the reason why this calculator was made, to establish these funky behaviors and predict anything that follows from them.
