        <h1>Herosite</h1>
        <h2>Herodirk's public website</h2>
        <p>A public website with Herodirk's calculators</p>
        <h2>Python Installation Guide</h2>
        <p>All the calculators run on Python. The calculators will not become public as exes, so you need to be able to run the python files yourself.</p>
        <p>You can run the programs either through a main terminal or through a code editor.</p>
        <p>If you're going to use a main terminal, this site gives a great tutorial:<br><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp">w3schools</a>.</p>
        <p>There are several options for code editors, Herodirk uses <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/">Spyder</a>, but <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> is probably better.</p>
        <h2>Hypixel Skyblock Calculators</h2>
        <p>Hypixel Skyblock is a minigame on the Hypixel Network (mc.hypixel.net), in this website it will be abbreviated to HSB.<br>
            HSB is a MMORPG made in Minecraft. It is a very grindy game, once you fully commit, you can spend thousands of hours playing without noticing.<br>
            HSB players like efficiency, their thousands of hours of playtime is valuable. That's why calculators are made to find the most efficient method and setup.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="/minion/index.html">Minion Calculator</a></h3>
        <p>Apart from manual grinding, there is also content that you do not have to do a lot for, basically like an idle game. Minions are one of these idle game like parts of HSB.<br>
            Minion work 24/7 on your private island. With only 2 actions they can perform, they really seem very simple. But like any good idle game, there are upgrades.<br>
            These upgrades can make things complicated very quickly. Especially when the code that is bringing these upgrades to life, can do some very funky things.<br>
            That's is the reason why this calculator was made, to establish these funky behaviors and predict anything that follows from them.</p>

        <h2>Support Server</h2>
        <p>A discord server exists for questions that cannot be answered by this website. Please only go there if you really cannot find what you are looking for.<br>

            Bug reports and suggestions can also be posted in this server.

        <p>Herodirk: I'm going to try to make a dark mode for this website soon. Sorry for the flashbang</p>
