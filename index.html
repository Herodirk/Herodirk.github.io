        <h1>Herosite</h1>
A public website with Herodirk's calculators.

        <h2>Python Installation Guide</h2>
All the calculators run on Python. The calculators will not become public as exes, so you need to be able to run the python files yourself.<br>
Programs to run Python files are called Python interpreters. Most Python code editors come with a Python interpreter.<br>
There are a lot of stand-alone Python interpreters and a lot of code editors with interpreters.<br>
Shown here are two examples, one code editor and one stand-alone interpreter: Spyder from Anaconda and standard Python.<br>
If you are already experienced with a different Python interpreter or code editor, you can use that.<br>
<br>
To get Spyder from Anaconda, you first have to install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>.<br>
You can skip any registration by clicking the "free download" button in the top right and then clicking "skip registration" underneath the submit button.<br>
After installing Anaconda, you can open Spyder from the Anaconda Navigator.<br>
The main benefit of this program is that Anaconda automatically installs several Python modules, which are also the ones needed for the calculators.<br>
<br>
Standard Python is run through the command promt of your system, this site gives a great tutorial: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp">w3schools</a>.<br>
<br>
For both methods you need to specify a version of Python, Herodirk uses Python 3.12.4 to make the calculators.<br>
The differences in Python versions is not that significant for simple programs like calculators, so other versions might work.

        <h2>Calculator Usage Guide</h2>
Now with Python ready, you can download the files for the calculator you want.<br>
Always download the files from <a href="https://github.com/Herodirk">Herodirk's GitHub</a> and get the latest release.<br>
Direct links to the releases of each calculator is at the top of their manual.<br>
Make sure that all the files for the calculator are in the same folder. Do not mix files from different calculators in one folder.<br>
Then with the Python interpreter of your choice, run the main file of the calculator which are always called <span>main.py</span>.<br>
The calculators are programmed as functions. Meaning to actually start the calculator after running the file, you have to run a function.<br>
The function to start a calculator will always be <span>start_app()</span>.<br>
To stop a calculator, there is a button labeled <span>Stop</span> in the bottom right of every calculator.


        <h2>Hypixel Skyblock Calculators</h2>
Hypixel Skyblock is a minigame on the Hypixel Network (<a href="https://hypixel.net/">mc.hypixel.net</a>). Hypixel Skyblock will be abbreviated to HSB from now on.<br>
HSB is a MMORPG made in Minecraft. It is a very grindy game, once you fully commit, you can spend thousands of hours playing without noticing.<br>
HSB players like efficiency, their thousands of hours of playtime is valuable. That's why calculators are made to find the most efficient method and setup.
        
        <h3><a href="/minion/index.html">Minion Calculator</a></h3>
Apart from manual grinding, there is also content that you do not have to do a lot for, basically like an idle game. Minions are one of these idle game like parts of HSB.<br>
Minion work 24/7 on your private island. With only 2 actions they can perform, they really seem very simple. But like any good idle game, there are upgrades.<br>
These upgrades can make things complicated very quickly. Especially when the code that is bringing these upgrades to life, can do some very funky things.<br>
That's is the reason why this calculator was made, to establish these funky behaviors and predict anything that follows from them.
