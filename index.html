        <h1>Herosite</h1>
        <h2>Herodirk's public website</h2>
        <p>A public website with Herodirk's calculators</p>
        <h2>Python Installation Guide</h2>
        <p>All my calculators run on Python. I will not make the calculators public as an exe, so you need to be able to run the python files yourself.</p>
        <p>You can run the programs either through a main terminal or through a code editor.</p>
        <p>If you're going to use a main terminal, this site gives a great tutorial:<br><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp">w3schools</a>.</p>
        <p>There are several options for code editors, I use <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/">Spyder</a>, but <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> is probably better.</p>
        <h2>Hypixel Skyblock Calculators</h2>
        <h3><a href="/minion/index.html"></a>Minion Calculator</h3>
        
        <p>I'm going to try to make a dark mode for this website soon.</p>
